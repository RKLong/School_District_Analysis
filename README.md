# A note for the person cchecking my work.
I apologize for the state of "this". I know that the work is incomplete but I would rather submit something than nothing. I have been sick the entire week (an extreme case of pseudo-covid post vaccine symptoms) and was only able to accomplish most of the tasks today. I am not asking for sympathy but giving an explanantion for "this". I think I could have at least accomplished deliverable 1(?)

I am still interested in resubmitting my work after I've completed it; I hope I can still do that. I still want to finish it and have it looked over by someone. And Yes, I understand that whatever grade I get from whatever I submit today is final. 

Sincerely
Richelle Long
