# School_District_Analysis

UCB Challenge: Apply pandas and NumPy to be able to come up with a more accurate data that can be used for the school district's analysis of 10th-12th grader's reading and math scores.

# Overview of the School District Analysis
The first objective is to be able to replace the math and reading scores for one of the high schools while keeping the rest of the data intact. Before repeating the school district analysis, we took out all the scores for that grade level in that high school so it doesnt affect the overall numbers of the school district.

## Effects to Thomas High School's Performance Relative to the Other Schools After Replacing Math and Reading Scores

* Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores, did not affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools. I personally think that removing the scores was a good practice, specifically if another analysis or comparison was to be made in terms of per grade level, it would have been unfair for the rest of the schools in the district. The reason as to why the scores might have been manipulated is because the scores of these students might bring the Thomas High School's overall scores lower. 


## Effects of Replacing the Ninth-Grade Scores  

* Math and Reading Scores by Grade
The Math and Reading scores for the 9th graders who attended Thomas High school now shows Nan, instead of a numeric value, after the ninth grade scores in these two school subjects were replaced.

* Scores by School Spending
Since the Ninth-graders were not included in the computation or statistics, the values in terms of school spending are almost the same.

* Scores by School Size
The overall passing percentage were not altered, regardless of the school's size.

* Scores by school type
The scores by school type did not change at all.
